Assist me is an accessibility plugin. Making web accessible

== Description ==

ASSIST ME GIVES CONTROL TO THE VISITOR OF YOUR WEBSITE SO ALL CAN BE INCLUDED
Given the global digital transformation & aging population, a lot of people will be missing out from digital products and services.Digital accessibility is the key for businesses and organisations not only to be compliant with laws and regulations but also to be capturing the undervalued spending power of disabled households Â£274billion in the UK ($490billion in the US).

A few notes about the sections above:

*   shafia6
*   Accessibilty, web accessibility, visual impaired, hearing impaired, autism
*   1.0.1
*   1.0.1
*   Stable tag should indicate the Subversion "tag" of the latest stable version, or "trunk," if you use `/trunk/` for
stable.

    Note that the `readme.txt` of the stable tag is the one that is considered the defining one for the plugin, so
if the `/trunk/readme.txt` file says that the stable tag is `4.3`, then it is `/tags/4.3/readme.txt` that'll be used
for displaying information about the plugin.  In this situation, the only thing considered from the trunk `readme.txt`
is the stable tag pointer.  Thus, if you develop in trunk, you can update the trunk `readme.txt` to reflect changes in
your in-development version, without having that information incorrectly disclosed about the current stable version
that lacks those changes -- as long as the trunk's `readme.txt` points to the correct stable tag.

    If no stable tag is provided, it is assumed that trunk is stable, but you should specify "trunk" if that's where
you put the stable version, in order to eliminate any doubt.
